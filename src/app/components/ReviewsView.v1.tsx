The food and drinks were pretty good and I would definitely recommend this to all the non veg lovers. The restaurant is pretty big and can accommodate a huge crowd with indoor as well as outdoor seating. The prices for the dishes are reasonable and totally worth it.\n\nMy personal favorites were the desserts, especially the DIY cake station where you pick toppings and sauces. The staff explained every course without rushing us, and water refills were constant without having to wave someone down. We also tried the chef’s special grill platter: smoky, tender, and seasoned well without hiding the ingredients.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, the music near the bar was a touch loud for conversation, but tables farther in were perfect. Parking nearby can fill up on weekends, so plan a few extra minutes. Overall this was one of the better dining experiences I have had in the area, and I would gladly return with friends or family. Would definitely visit again! ❤️",

The menu is diverse and thoughtfully curated, with enough variety that every person in our group found something they were excited about. We started with small plates to share and each dish arrived at a comfortable pace.\n\nThe servers were attentive and knowledgeable when we asked about allergens and spice levels. Wine suggestions paired well with our mains, and nobody felt rushed even though the dining room was full. Lighting and table spacing made it easy to hear each other, which matters for a celebratory dinner.\n\nDesserts were a highlight: not overly sweet, and plated with care. I would recommend Magna for date nights, small team dinners, or visitors who want a reliable splurge without gimmicks. I am already planning a return visit to work through more of the menu.",

There are several seating zones, from quieter corners to a livelier central area, so you can match the mood to your group. We visited on a Saturday evening and still found a comfortable table within ten minutes.\n\nThe portions are generous and easy to share. We ordered a mix of appetizers and mains and everything arrived hot. Staff checked in at the right moments and cleared plates promptly. The only minor issue was a short wait for the first round of drinks while the bar caught up with the rush.\n\nIf you are planning a birthday or casual reunion, this spot works well because you can linger without pressure to turn the table.

I tried the lunch express menu and you should definitely consider it if you want speed without sacrificing flavor. The regular menu also has plenty of variety, from lighter salads to hearty comfort plates.\n\nThe best part of our meal was dessert. I ordered the pastry special and it was flaky, balanced, and not cloying. Coffee was strong and served at the right temperature, which sounds small but makes a difference. Bathrooms were clean and stocked, always a good sign of how a restaurant is run day to day.\n\nWe sat near the window and had great natural light for photos, if that matters to you. Noise levels stayed reasonable even as more guests arrived. I would recommend this spot for a weekday lunch treat or a low key weekend meal.",

Reservations were honored on time, dietary restrictions were taken seriously, and the manager checked in once without hovering. The private dining area was set up with name cards and pitchers of water before we arrived, which made our kickoff feel organized.\n\nFood was plated consistently across a long table, so nobody waited awkwardly while others ate. Vegetarian and gluten free requests were handled confidently, and the kitchen split a few dishes so we could sample more items. Audio in the room was clear enough for short toasts without shouting.\n\nPricing matched what we were quoted, and gratuity options were explained upfront. Several colleagues asked for the name of the restaurant afterward, which is the best endorsement I can give. We will book again for our quarterly outing and probably for client dinners too.",

The server apologized and offered to reheat, but at this price point I expected tighter pacing and hotter plates on the first try. Starters and drinks were stronger than the entrees on this visit.\n\nI am not writing the place off entirely because the menu shows ambition, but management should look at timing on busy nights. If you go, ask for a table away from the bar and confirm your reservation buffer if you have tickets afterward.",

It took three separate asks to get water refills, and empty plates sat on the edge of the table for a long time. I understand everyone can have an off night, but the basics slipped repeatedly.\n\nWhen the correct dishes finally arrived, taste was average and temperature was acceptable. The manager offered a small discount after we flagged the issues, which helped a little, but we still left frustrated because the experience felt careless. Communication between the kitchen and the floor seemed disjointed from where we sat.\n\nI hope this was an outlier service night.

Sweet and savory options are balanced, so mixed groups do not have to compromise.\n\nPatio seating fills fast on weekends, so arrive early or expect a short wait. Once seated, service stayed attentive even as the room filled. One star off because parking was tight and the nearby garage rates add up if you linger.\n\nIf you go, order one savory plate and one pastry to share.

Wine by the glass list had enough depth that I did not feel stuck ordering the same bottle every night.\n\nBreakfast service was slightly slower on weekday mornings, yet food remained hot and accurate.

Seating is limited, so plan for takeaway if you visit at peak times.

    text: "Solid weekday lunch spot with predictable quality. The soup and half sandwich deal is a bargain given the portion size, and the soup tasted like it was made in house rather than poured from a bag. Ingredients in the sandwich were fresh and the bread held up without falling apart.\n\nWi Fi was reliable enough if you need to answer email between bites, and outlets were available along the wall. Noise stayed at a workable level for a quick working lunch. Lines move quickly because the menu is focused.\n\nIf you want something indulgent, the cookie at the register is worth adding. I have been back three times this month and have not had a miss yet.",

    text: "Our anniversary dinner exceeded expectations in almost every way. The sommelier pairing was thoughtful without being pushy, and each pour matched the food rather than overpowering it. Pacing between courses was perfect: long enough to enjoy, short enough to stay engaged.\n\nThe kitchen accommodated a shellfish allergy with calm confidence and swapped components without making us feel like a burden. Bread, butter, and small touches felt intentional. At the end of the meal we received a handwritten note, which was a lovely surprise and felt personal.\n\nWe left full but not uncomfortable, and the staff thanked us warmly on the way out. This is the kind of evening you remember months later. We will return for the next milestone.",

    text: "Our delivery order arrived cold and missing sides, which is frustrating when you are ordering for a group at home. In app support offered a partial credit only, and the back and forth took longer than remaking the meal would have. In person visits have been better in the past, so this felt like a different standard.\n\nWhen we have dined inside, food was hot and accurate, which makes the delivery gap more noticeable. Packaging may need a rethink for anything saucy, and checklists should confirm sides before drivers leave.\n\nI am leaving two stars instead of one because I know this brand can do better based on prior experiences. I hope operations tighten delivery QA soon.",
