The food and drinks were pretty good and I would definitely recommend this to all the non veg lovers. The restaurant is pretty big and can accommodate a huge crowd with indoor as well as outdoor seating. The prices for the dishes are reasonable and totally worth it.\n\nMy personal favorites were the desserts, especially the DIY cake station where you pick toppings and sauces. The staff explained every course without rushing us, and water refills were constant without having to wave someone down.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, the music near the bar was a touch loud for conversation, but tables farther in were perfect. Parking nearby can fill up on weekends, so plan a few extra minutes. Overall this was one of the better dining experiences I have had in the area.",

Wine suggestions paired well with our mains, and nobody felt rushed even though the dining room was full.\n\nDesserts were a highlight: not overly sweet, and plated with care. I would recommend Magna for date nights, small team dinners, or visitors who want a reliable splurge without gimmicks.",
